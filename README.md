# PasswordWebsite

This website was designed for user to assess a password that they are planning on using. The aim of the website is to give users
a visual and easy to understand representation of how secure their password would be if they were to use it.
The password check works by having the user enter their prospective password into a textbox at the top of the main page and then
clicking the button below. The password checker has six different criteria for assessing the password
although only three are currentlyfunctioning.
The first criteria is length of the password, the longer the password the better.
The second criteria is capital letters, having a few will increase the passwords variety of characters.
The third criteria is special characters, having these characters will also improve a password.
The fourth criteria is numbers, including numbers in password also improves variety.
The fifth criteria is repeated characters, having too many repeated characters will make a password easier to guess.
The sixth criteria is reused passwords, a common tactic to brute force accounts is to use a database of
well known passwords so it is better to use a very unique one.
The password checkers criteria is shown on the webpage and when a password is assessed they change colour
to represent the passwords quality.
If the criteria turns red it means the password is poor in that area, yellow means it was okay and green means that it was good.
