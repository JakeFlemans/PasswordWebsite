    <center>Explanation of how website works:</center></br>
    <center>Enter your password into the text box on the main page and click the button to assess it</center>
    <center>Upon clicking the button the six criteria will change colour to represent the quality of the password</center>
    <center>Red = Bad   Yellow = Okay   Green = Good</center>
    <center>The Hue lights will also change colour to sync up with the criteria colours</center></br>
    <center>Explination of password Assessment criteria:</center></br>
    <center>Length: The system judges a password based on its length, the longer the password the better</center>
    <center>Capital Letters: The assessor checks the password to identify capital letters, having a few capital letters improves the password</center>
    <center>Special Character: The given password is checked for special characters, a password is stronger with a small amount</center>
    <center>Numbers: Any numbers in the password are identified, having numbers creates a stronger password</center>
    <center>Repeating characters: Some repeating characters are expected in any password but too many will result in a weaker one</center>
    <center>Reused Password: Reusing your own password or one commonly used by other automatically makes it a weak password</center>
